MADS is a 100% self-service no-code intuitive IoT platform for rapid implementation of enterprise IoT projects. It enables quick development, management, and scaling of IoT projects. MADS is available both as an on-cloud and on-premises solution.

## Feature Highlights

With MADS you are able to:

* Define your multi-level IoT project hierarchy exactly as in the real world
* Define the relation between your project entities ([assets]({{<ref "/apps/entity-manager/assets">}}) and [sensors]({{<ref "/apps/entity-manager/sensors">}}))
* Provision IoT gateways (devices) for your IoT streaming data
* Collect and visualize data from your assets and sensors
* Perform aggregated trend analytics on historical data
* Analyze incoming sensor data and trigger alarms with customizable event rules
* Design dynamic and responsive dashboards and share them externally
* Enable use-case specific features using customizable stream rules
* And much more ...

## MADS Overview

The simplest way to understand the building blocks of an IoT project is:

Hardware → Communication → Software Backend → Applications

The **MADS Core** sits in the *Software Backend* layer, does all the heavy lifting, and interacts with the **MADS Frontend** ie. the *Applications* layer through a set of APIs. We call the combined MADS Core and Frontend experience the MADS Platform. Now talking about the layers below – MADS supports major IoT *Communication* protocols such as HTTPS, MQTT, CoAP, and it agnostic to the IoT *Hardware*, commonly referred to as device or gateway. This means MADS can ingest data from any hardware source (sensors, gateways, devices of any brand, of any output type ie. RS485, 4-20mA, 0-10V, pulse, etc., over any channel ie. WiFi, 3G/4G, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, Satellite, etc.) as long as they are communicating over the supported protocols (HTTPS, MQTT, CoAP).

The MADS platform consists of multiple blocks responsible for handling different aspects needed to run a complete IoT platform (as shown in the figure below). And one of the most important user-facing blocks is the MADS AppStore. MADS is an app-based platform with a very intuitive OS-like UI.

The apps in the MADS AppStore can be segregated into six categories:

* Core
* Productivity
* Management
* Analytics
* Security
* General
