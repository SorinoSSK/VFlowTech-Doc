An IoT platform is a multi-layer software that enables easy provisioning, management, and automation of connected devices within the Internet of Things ([IoT]({{< ref "what-is-iot" >}} "Internet of Things")) universe. It basically connects any hardware device, however diverse, to the cloud by using flexible connectivity options, enterprise-grade security mechanisms, and broad data processing powers. For users, an IoT platform provides a set of ready-to-use features that greatly speed up development of applications for connected devices as well as take care of scalability and cross-device compatibility.
