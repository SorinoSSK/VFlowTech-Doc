_Wikipedia_ defines the Internet of Things (IoT) as the network of physical objects — “things” — that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.

At Team MADS, we follow a simpler definition.

```markdown
Internet of Things = Interconnected assets to benefit humans
```

There were over 30 billion active IoT devices globally in 2020, and by 2025 this number is expected to grow by more than 2.5x and hit to over 75 billion. By 2025, the total addressable market of IoT will grow over a trillion dollars, making it _the most valued_ disruptive technology.

IoT is creating new applications and business opportunities in different industries. But the [MADS platform]({{<ref "apps/vft/what-is-vft">}} "MADS Platform") is industry agnostic and can be used to build any enterprise IoT applications using its building blocks (apps). The following illustration fairly describes a non-exhaustive span of IoT applications areas that MADS can support.

With the rapid adoption of IoT in multiple verticals, it is increasingly becoming a part of our everyday life. Some estimates project that **Enterprise IoT** is going to be the biggest segment among all connected devices in the next five years. The IoT data explosion is massive – IoT is generating more data than anything ever before, in the order of zettabytes. The next decade will be the decade of IoT and associated technologies – AI, Big Data, Blockchain.

## Enterprise IoT vs Consumer IoT

MADS is targetted towards Enterprise IoT (aka. Industrial IoT).
