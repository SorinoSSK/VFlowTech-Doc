## Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The Data Insights app allows aggregated data analytics and visualisation, historical trends or future forecasts of VFlowTech Energy System data. Using this app, we can gather data and transform them into something useful that can be presented visually so that users can understand what the data is representing. We can also store these visual representations created by user so that they can refer it later.
</p>

The icon below denotes Data Insights app.
