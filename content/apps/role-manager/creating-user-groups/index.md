## Introduction
<p style="text-align: justify;">
User Groups is used to invite a new user to the organisation. It can also be used to set policies/apps and action items for each user group. We can create multiple User groups. In the next section, we'll understand how it works with user invitation.
</p>

At the top right corner of User Groups list, there is an add user Group button.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Clicking on <b>Create New User Group</b> button will open up a modal. The modal contains two sub sections - User Groups and Apps and actions.

Then clicking on next will take us to the next section named Apps and Actions where we can allocated the apps and action items for the user group. We can also select all apps and action items also by selecting the <b>Select All</b> checkbox.
</p>

After entering the details, clicking on save button will create a User Group for us.
