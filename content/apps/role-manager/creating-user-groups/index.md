## Introduction

We need User Groups for inviting a user. It is basically used to set the policies/apps and action items. We can create multiple User groups. In the next section, we'll understand how it works with user invitation.

## Creating a User Group

To create a User Group, we need to go on User Groups tab. Click on below icon to open User Groups tab.

User groups tab opens up which displayes the list of User Groups.

On the top right of User Groups list, there is an Add User Group button.

Clicking on this button will open up a modal. The modal contains two sections - User Groups and Apps and actions.

In the first section named User Groups, we have to enter the User Group name.

Then clicking on next will take us to the next section named Apps and Actions where we select the apps and action items. We can select all apps and action items also by selecting the select all checkbox.

After entering the details, clicking on save button will create a User Group for us.
