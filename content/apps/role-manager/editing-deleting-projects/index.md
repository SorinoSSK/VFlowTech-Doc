After Changing the details, clicking on save button will edit a Project for us.

## Archiving and UnArchiving a Project

A project can be archived if it is in active projects list and unarchived if it is present in archived projects list.

In the Active projects list, there is an actions column which has an icon to Archive a project.

{{< img-simple src="archive-project.png" alt="Role Manager app" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

Clicking on this icon will archive the project and move it to Archived projects list.

Similarly, in the Archived projects list, there is an actions column which has an icon to UnArchive a project.

{{< img-simple src="unarchive-project.png" alt="Role Manager app" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

Clicking on this icon will unarchive the project and move it to Active projects list.
