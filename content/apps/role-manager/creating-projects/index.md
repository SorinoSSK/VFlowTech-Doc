On the top right of Active Projects list, there is an Add project button.

Clicking on this button will open up a modal. The modal contains three sections - Details, People and Metadata (Fixed Data).

In the first section named Details, we have to enter the Project name (mandatory), itâ€™s description, location and image (optional). Click on next button after entering the details.

Then clicking on next will take us to the last section named Metadata (Fixed Data) where we add Metadata Name, Data Type, Unit and it's value. We can create multiple Metadata using the Add New button.

After entering the details, clicking on save button will create a new project for us.

This is how we create Projects.

## Archiving and UnArchiving a Project

A project can be archived if it is in active projects list and unarchived if it is present in archived projects list.

In the Active projects list, there is an actions column which has an icon to Archive a project.

{{< img-simple src="archive-project.png" alt="Role Manager app" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

Clicking on this icon will archive the project and move it to Archived projects list.

Similarly, in the Archived projects list, there is an actions column which has an icon to UnArchive a project.

{{< img-simple src="unarchive-project.png" alt="Role Manager app" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

Clicking on this icon will unarchive the project and move it to Active projects list.
