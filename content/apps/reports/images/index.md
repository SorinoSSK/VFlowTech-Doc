## Introduction

The image section is used to add or edit the new images in the report. We can go to the image section by clicking on `Images` in the report sidebar.

The images section consists of 2 parts, i.e.,

1. Organization images
2. Third party images

In Organization images, we can upload new images for the particular organization.

{{< img-simple src="organization-image.png" alt="Organization images" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

In third party images, we have many sample images that we can use directly inside the report.

{{< img-simple src="third-party-image.png" alt="Organization images" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

The image section consists of various functions like searching for images from the organisation image or third party images, deleting the selected image by clicking on the delete button which is at the top right corner, and uploading new images for the organization. We can also drag and drop or resize the particular image.
