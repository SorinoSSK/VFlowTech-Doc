### Realtime settings

This is used when user want to view the realtime data with the help of widgets.

### Historical Settings

Relative Settings

Absolute Settings

**Note** <br/>
When user change these settings, it will be applicable to all of the widgets present on the current dashboard tab. These settings will not be shared across other tabs. <br/>

However if user wants to change realtime historical settings for a single widget, he can achieve this by clicking on the icon present at the top right corner of every widget as shown below. <br/>
{{< img-simple src="widget-realtime-historical-settings.png" alt="Dashboards app" class="border-0 rounded-circle" >}}

But these individaul widget realtime historical settings will not be saved, means if user goes away from this tab and comes back again, then all widgets will have the realtime historical settings which we have set for the whole tab from the dashboard header icon.
